# kannadakali

This is a pet project of mine where I'm trying to teach non-Kannadiga people to learn Kannada on a daily basis for basic communication with Karnataka people.
This project will be initially hosted on Heroku and later will be hosted on the domain.

Here, people who want to learn Kannada can register themselves and then every day a newsletter will be dispatched to their mail, which mainly consists of one basic sentence in English and its translation in Kannada.
